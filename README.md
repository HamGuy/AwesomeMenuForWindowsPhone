AwesomeMenu for Windows Phone, which was coded with C# based on the levey's QuadCurveMenu(https://github.com/levey/QuadCurveMenu/") and the extention QuadcurveMenu by 念风2012 (http://blog.csdn.net/toss156/article/details/7385517)
Thanks for the sharing!

There are some bugs now ,

1. the tapped menuitem could not dismissed after animation
2. the addbutton rotated exceptionally when the menu is collapsed
3. the menu's Tap event is conflicting with the menuitem's Click event

And I need your help, thank you very much!
